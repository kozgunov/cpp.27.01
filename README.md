# Project Documentation

## Introduction
This document presents the technical specification for a student course project.
The project’s objective is to create a C++ console application that reads a
mathematical function from a file, expands it into a Taylor series, finds its
roots, and generates a detailed solution in a PDF file using LaTeX.

## Requirements
1. Functional Requirements:
• The application must read a mathematical function from a text file.
• The program should expand the function into a Taylor series around a given point.
• The application should find the roots of the Taylor series.
• The solution process, including the Taylor series expansion and root finding, must be formatted and presented in a LaTeX-generated PDF file.
2. Technical Requirements
• The application must be developed in C++.
• It should be operable via a command-line interface.
• Integration with LaTeX for generating the PDF report is required.
• The program must effectively handle common errors, such as file not found or incorrect function syntax.

# Evaluation criteria:
• Accuracy of the Taylor series expansion and root finding.
• Code quality, including readability, structure, and adherence to coding
standards.
• Quality and completeness of the documentation.
• Usability and reliability of the program.



## Design and Architecture
The software is designed as a console application with the following components...

## Implementation Details
### Reading a Mathematical Function
The function is read from a file using txt_reader.cpp file, which process every line, afterward it output the content of file and close it. handle errors like empty file & existence of file.

### Taylor Series Expansion
The Taylor series is expanded using...

### Root Finding
Roots of the series are found using the Newton-Raphson method...

## Building and Running Instructions
To build and run the software, follow these steps...

## Examples and Usage
An example usage of the application is shown below...

## Troubleshooting
Common issues and solutions:

- **Issue 1**: Description and solution
- **Issue 2**: Description and solution

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project ...
