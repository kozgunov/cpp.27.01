# Project Documentation

## Introduction
This document presents the technical specification for a student course project.
The project’s objective is to create a C++ console application that reads a
mathematical function from a file, expands it into a Taylor series, finds its
roots, and generates a detailed solution in a PDF file using LaTeX.

## Requirements
1. Functional Requirements:
• The application must read a mathematical function from a text file.
• The program should expand the function into a Taylor series around a given point.
• The application should find the roots of the Taylor series.
• The solution process, including the Taylor series expansion and root finding, must be formatted and presented in a LaTeX-generated PDF file.
2. Technical Requirements
• The application must be developed in C++.
• It should be operable via a command-line interface.
• Integration with LaTeX for generating the PDF report is required.
• The program must effectively handle common errors, such as file not found or incorrect function syntax.

# Evaluation criteria:
• Accuracy of the Taylor series expansion and root finding.
• Code quality, including readability, structure, and adherence to coding
standards.
• Quality and completeness of the documentation.
• Usability and reliability of the program.
